AI Agent Skills for managing the complete GitLab workflow — plan milestones, track issues,
commit with traceability, open merge requests, and manage story/epic hierarchies via the
[`glab`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cli) CLI.

## Quickstart

Install for your agent: [Claude Code](#claude-code) · [Cursor](#cursor) · [Codex](#codex)

## How it works

When you ask your agent to open an issue, create a milestone, commit staged changes, draft a
merge request, or manage a story hierarchy, `gitlab-workflow` activates automatically. It reads
the codebase, pulls relevant context from git and GitLab, and builds a complete artifact draft —
title, labels, milestone, code snippets with exact `path/file.ext:line` citations, and Mermaid
diagrams where the policy calls for them.

Before running a single `glab` command, the agent shows you the full draft and waits for
explicit approval. If you request changes, it applies them and re-presents. Only when you confirm
does it publish to GitLab.

Artifacts are language-agnostic: section headings and prose follow your active language at
runtime. No language is hardcoded.

## Skills

### `gitlab-init` — Project label initializer

**Trigger phrases:** "Setup GitLab", "Initialize the project labels", "Configure labels",
"Init GitLab project"

**What it produces:**

- The labels the workflow relies on (`workflow::*`, `type::*`, `kind::*`), created in the current project
- Idempotent — labels already present are skipped, so it is safe to re-run any number of times

**Boundary:** one-time project bootstrap. Not for issue creation (→ `gitlab-track`) or milestones (→ `gitlab-plan`).

---

### `gitlab-plan` — Milestone author

**Trigger phrases:** "Create a milestone", "Plan sprint 5", "Start release v2.1",
"Close the current milestone", "Extend the due date of sprint 3"

**What it produces:**

- Milestone with title, start date, due date, and a goal description
- Candidate issues from the current backlog suggested for assignment
- Consistent naming with project versioning (`v1.2.0`, `Sprint 5`, `2026-Q2`)

**Modes:**

| Mode           | Command                                        | When to use                                 |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Create         | `glab milestone create`                        | New sprint or release                       |
| Update         | `glab milestone edit`                          | Extend deadline, rename, update description |
| Close / Reopen | `glab milestone edit --state close / activate` | End of sprint; re-open if work resumes      |

**Context extracted silently:** recent git log, active branches, existing milestones, open issues.

**Boundary:** not for issue creation (→ `gitlab-track`) or merge requests (→ `gitlab-review`).

---

### `gitlab-track` — Issue author

**Trigger phrases:** "Open a bug for…", "Track technical debt in…", "Propose a feature to…",
"Create a documentation issue for…", "Start working on #N", "Move #N to in review"

**Issue types:**

| Type             | Default label          | Template                                                    |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `bug`            | `type::bug`            | Steps to reproduce, root cause, affected area, code snippet |
| `feature`        | `type::feature`        | Problem, proposal, MVC, acceptance criteria, open questions |
| `technical-debt` | `type::technical-debt` | Current state, impact, proposed fix, effort estimate        |
| `documentation`  | `type::documentation`  | Scope, audience, sections to add or update                  |

**What it produces:**

- Issue with title (≥ 5 meaningful words), scoped labels, optional milestone
- Fenced code snippets of 5–20 lines with exact `path/file.ext line N` citations
- Mermaid diagrams for flows, component relationships, and state machines where relevant
- `workflow::ready` as initial lifecycle label

**Lifecycle transitions** (Transition mode):

```
workflow::ready → workflow::in dev → workflow::in review → workflow::done → closed
```

On transition to `workflow::in dev`, the skill offers to create a branch following the
`<type>/<issue-id>-<short-title>` convention (e.g. `fix/87-nil-pointer-handler`).

**Context extracted silently:** `git log`, `git diff HEAD`, `git blame` (bug/tech-debt),
codebase exploration with `Read`, `Grep`, `Glob`.

**Boundary:** not for merge requests (→ `gitlab-review`) or milestones (→ `gitlab-plan`).

---

### `gitlab-commit` — Commit author

**Trigger phrases:** "Commit staged changes", "Save progress", "Finalize this", or implicitly
when the agent signals that implementation work is complete.

**What it produces:**

Conventional Commit message ([v1.0.0 spec](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)) with the
GitLab issue ID as scope, extracted from the branch name:

```
fix(#87): handle nil pointer in user handler

Closes #87
```

**Branch-to-type mapping:**

| Branch prefix                | Commit type | Footer          |
| ---------------------------- | ----------- | --------------- |
| `fix/`, `hotfix/`, `bugfix/` | `fix`       | `Closes #N`     |
| `feature/`                   | `feat`      | `Closes #N`     |
| `refactor/`                  | `refactor`  | `Related to #N` |
| `docs/`                      | `docs`      | `Related to #N` |
| `chore/`                     | `chore`     | (none)          |

The scope is always `#N` (issue ID), never a directory name.

**Guard:** does not auto-stage files. Stops if nothing is staged.

**Context extracted silently:** `git branch --show-current`, `git diff --staged --stat`,
`git log --oneline -5`.

**Boundary:** does not push. Does not create MRs (→ `gitlab-review`).

---

### `gitlab-review` — Merge request author

**Trigger phrases:** "Create MR for this branch", "Write the MR description", "Draft merge
request and close #42", "Open a WIP MR"

**What it produces:**

- MR title with conventional commit prefix matching branch intent
- Description with change summary, code snippets (5–20 lines, `path/file.ext line N`),
  reviewer notes (omitted if no non-obvious design decisions), and closing references
- `Closes #N` / `Related to #N` aggregated from commit history — never guessed
- Labels and milestone inferred from associated issues

**Modes:**

| Mode  | Flag      | When to use                             |
| ----- | --------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Ready | (none)    | Branch is ready to merge                |
| Draft | `--draft` | Work in progress, early feedback needed |

**Context extracted silently:** `git log <base>...HEAD`, `git diff <base>...HEAD`, commit
message bodies parsed for `Closes #N` / `Related to #N` patterns.

**Post-creation:** offers to move the linked issue to `workflow::in review`.

**Boundary:** not for issue creation (→ `gitlab-track`) or milestones (→ `gitlab-plan`).

---

### `gitlab-story` — Story and epic hierarchy author _(v1.1.0)_

**Trigger phrases:** "Create a story for…", "Create an epic for…", "Add issue #12 to story #10",
"Sync the children of story #10", "Link MR !5 to story #10"

**What it produces:**

Parent issue with `kind::story` or `kind::epic` label, a structured description, and a live
markdown children table tracking all child issues:

```
| # | Title | Type | Status | MR |
|---|-------|------|--------|----|
| [#11](…) | Handle OAuth token expiry | `type::feature` | `workflow::in dev` | !5 |
| [#12](…) | Add refresh token rotation | `type::feature` | `workflow::ready` | — |
```

Child issues are linked to the parent via the Issue Links REST API
(`glab api --method POST "projects/:id/issues/<iid>/links"`, `link_type=relates_to`).

**Modes:**

| Mode          | When to use                                                                           |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Create**    | Start a new epic or story with an empty children table                                |
| **Add-Child** | Link existing issues or create new minimal issues as children                         |
| **Sync**      | Refresh all child statuses from GitLab into the parent description table              |
| **Link-MR**   | Attach an MR reference to the parent and update the MR column for referenced children |

**Simulates Scrum hierarchy on GitLab Free:**

```
epic (kind::epic)
└── story (kind::story)
    ├── feature issue #11  (type::feature, workflow::in dev, MR !5)
    └── feature issue #12  (type::feature, workflow::ready)
```

No GitLab Premium required. Hierarchy state is persisted entirely in the parent issue description.

**Boundary:** not for leaf issues (→ `gitlab-track`) or milestones (→ `gitlab-plan`).

---

### `gitlab-release` — Release author _(v1.0.0)_

**Trigger phrases:** "Cut a release", "Prepare release v1.5.0", "Finalize the release",
"Start the release process"

**What it produces:**

- A `release/vX.Y.Z` branch cut from the integration branch (`develop` by default)
- A `CHANGELOG.md` entry ([keepachangelog 1.1.0](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/))
  built from Conventional Commits since the last tag, with a recommended version bump
- A **draft** merge request from `release/vX.Y.Z` toward the default branch

The version is detected from the latest semver tag (or a version file), bumped per commit
history — `BREAKING CHANGE` / `type!` → major, any `feat` → minor, otherwise patch — and
confirmed by you. The git tag and branch use `vX.Y.Z`; the CHANGELOG heading uses `[X.Y.Z]`
per keepachangelog.

**Delegates** MR creation to `gitlab-review` — it never calls `glab mr create` itself, so the
draft gate runs twice (once on the CHANGELOG, once in `gitlab-review`).

**Context extracted silently:** `git status --porcelain`, `git tag --sort=-v:refname`,
`git log <last-tag>..HEAD`, default-branch detection via `git symbolic-ref`.

**Boundary:** not for plain commits (→ `gitlab-commit`). Scope ends at the draft MR — tagging
and back-merging into the integration branch happen after a human merges it.

## Commands

### `/gitlab-doctor` — Environment health check

A slash command (not a skill) that verifies your setup before running the workflow skills:

- Confirms the `glab` CLI is installed
- Confirms you are authenticated (`glab auth status`)
- Prints install/login guidance and exits non-zero when something is missing

```
/gitlab-doctor              # check gitlab.com
/gitlab-doctor <hostname>   # check a self-managed instance
/gitlab-doctor help         # usage
```

```

## Artifact style

Conventions applied across all skills:

- Dense, affirmative technical prose — no emoji, no filler preambles
- `path/file.ext line N` citation for every code snippet
- Fenced code blocks of 5–20 lines per significant point
- `- [ ]` checklists for activities and requirements
- Mermaid diagrams for flows and component relationships where relevant
- All glab commands use `--description "$(cat /tmp/file.md)"` — never `--body`

Section headings and prose follow your active language at runtime.

## Contributing

### Adding a new sub-skill

1. Create `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` with all required frontmatter fields (see [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md))
2. Add `assets/<type>.md` templates for each artifact type the skill handles
3. Optionally add `references/` for detailed documentation
4. Add `"<name>"` to the `skills` array in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`, and `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`
5. Run the description quality check: contains `GitLab`, has "Use when" trigger clause, no over-triggering patterns

### Modifying an existing skill

After changes:

1. Increment `metadata.version` in the changed `SKILL.md`
2. Bump `version` in `package.json`
3. Format: `npx prettier --write "**/*.md"`
4. Measure token count: `npx tiktoken-cli skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (target: < 2500)
